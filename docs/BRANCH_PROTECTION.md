# Branch Protection and Merge Policy

## Purpose

Quality gates (conformance, clippy, tests, coverage) only protect the
codebase if they cannot be bypassed during the merge workflow. This
document specifies the required branch protection rules for the `main`
branch and documents how each CI gate maps to a required status check.

## Required Status Checks

The following checks must pass before a PR can be merged to `main`:

| CI Job | Workflow | Required | Blocks Merge |
|--------|----------|----------|--------------|
| `rust (ubuntu-latest)` | `ci.yml` | Yes | Yes |
| `rust (macos-latest)` | `ci.yml` | Yes | Yes |
| `rust (windows-latest)` | `ci.yml` | Yes | Yes |
| `conformance (fast-official)` | `conformance.yml` | Yes | Yes |
| `conformance (fast-generated)` | `conformance.yml` | Yes | Yes |
| `conformance (fast-negative)` | `conformance.yml` | Yes | Yes |
| `conformance (fast-capability-matrix)` | `conformance.yml` | Yes | Yes |

## What Each Gate Enforces

### CI Pipeline (`ci.yml`)

Per-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows):

1. **No-mock dependency guard** — Blocks `mockall`, `mockito`, `wiremock` in `Cargo.toml`/`Cargo.lock`.
2. **No-mock code guard** — Blocks `Mock*/Fake*/Stub*` identifiers in test code (allowlisted: `MockHttp{Server,Request,Response}`).
3. **Traceability matrix guard** — Validates `docs/traceability_matrix.json` consistency.
4. **Suite classification guard** — Every `tests/*.rs` must appear in `tests/suite_classification.toml`.
5. **VCR leak guard** — Unit-suite files must not reference VCR infrastructure.
6. **`cargo fmt --check`** — Format compliance.
7. **`cargo clippy -D warnings`** — Zero clippy warnings.
8. **`cargo doc --no-deps`** — Documentation builds cleanly.
9. **`cargo test --all-targets`** — All tests pass.
10. **Unified verification runner** — `scripts/e2e/run_all.sh --profile ci` (Linux only).
11. **CI gate promotion** — Conformance thresholds enforced (Linux only).
12. **Conformance regression gate** — No pass-rate regressions (Linux only).
13. **Coverage gate** — Line coverage >= 50% (Linux only).

### Conformance Pipeline (`conformance.yml`)

On PRs, four fast conformance checks run:

1. **fast-official** — Sample of official extensions (max 5).
2. **fast-generated** — Generated tier 1-2 scenarios.
3. **fast-negative** — Negative policy tests.
4. **fast-capability-matrix** — Capability denial matrix.

## GitHub Branch Protection Settings

### Recommended Configuration for `main`

```
Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules → main
```

| Setting | Value | Rationale |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Require a pull request before merging | Enabled | No direct pushes to main |
| Required approvals | 1 | Minimum review gate |
| Dismiss stale pull request approvals | Enabled | Re-review after force-push |
| Require status checks to pass before merging | Enabled | CI gates are mandatory |
| Require branches to be up to date before merging | Enabled | Prevents stale merges |
| Required status checks | See [Required Status Checks](#required-status-checks) | All listed checks |
| Require conversation resolution before merging | Enabled | No unresolved threads |
| Require signed commits | Recommended | Commit provenance |
| Include administrators | Enabled | No admin bypass |
| Allow force pushes | Disabled | Prevents history rewriting |
| Allow deletions | Disabled | Prevents branch deletion |

### Applying via GitHub CLI

```bash
# Set required status checks (adjust repo owner/name):
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/main/protection \
  --method PUT \
  --field required_status_checks='{"strict":true,"contexts":["rust (ubuntu-latest)","rust (macos-latest)","rust (windows-latest)","conformance (fast-official)","conformance (fast-generated)","conformance (fast-negative)","conformance (fast-capability-matrix)"]}' \
  --field enforce_admins=true \
  --field required_pull_request_reviews='{"required_approving_review_count":1,"dismiss_stale_reviews":true}' \
  --field restrictions=null \
  --field allow_force_pushes=false \
  --field allow_deletions=false
```

## Validation Script

Run `scripts/check_branch_protection.sh` to validate that branch
protection is correctly configured. This checks:

1. Required status checks are present.
2. `strict` mode (up-to-date branches) is enabled.
3. Admin enforcement is enabled.
4. Force pushes are disabled.
5. Deletions are disabled.
6. Pull request reviews are required.

## Release Workflow Integration

The release workflow (`release.yml`) triggers on version tags (`v*`).
Because releases are created from `main`, the branch protection rules
ensure that only code that passed all CI gates can be released.

The `scripts/release_gate.sh` script provides an additional local or CI
pre-release check that validates the conformance evidence bundle meets
minimum thresholds before a release tag is created.

### Pre-Release Checklist

1. All CI checks pass on `main`.
2. `scripts/release_gate.sh --report` returns `verdict: pass`.
3. Conformance pass rate >= 80% (configurable via `RELEASE_GATE_MIN_PASS_RATE`).
4. Conformance failures <= 36 (configurable via `RELEASE_GATE_MAX_FAIL_COUNT`).
5. Tag follows semver: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-prerelease]`.

## Bypass Prevention

### What Cannot Be Bypassed

- Status checks: Required for all users including administrators.
- PR requirement: Direct pushes to `main` are blocked.
- Format and lint: `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy -D warnings`.

### Emergency Procedures

In genuine emergencies (e.g., security patches), a repository admin can
temporarily disable branch protection. This must be:

1. Documented in a GitHub issue with justification.
2. Re-enabled immediately after the emergency merge.
3. Reviewed in the next team sync.

## Monitoring

### CI Health Dashboard

Track these metrics weekly:

- **Flake rate**: Transient failures / total runs (target: < 5%).
- **Mean CI duration**: Average wall-clock time for the `ci` workflow.
- **Coverage trend**: Line coverage over time (floor: 50%).
- **Conformance pass rate**: Extension conformance trend.

### Alerts

- CI flake rate exceeds 5% → investigate per-target flake budgets.
- Coverage drops below 50% → `cargo llvm-cov` gate will block merge.
- Conformance pass rate drops → `CI_GATE_PROMOTION_MODE=strict` blocks merge.
