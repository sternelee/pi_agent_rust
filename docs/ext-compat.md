# Legacy Pi Extension Compatibility (Best‑Effort)

This document maps the **legacy Pi extension API** to the new protocol and
defines compatibility tiers. The goal is **best‑effort parity** with clear,
actionable warnings where behavior diverges.

---

## 0. Reality Check: Legacy Extensions Do Not Need Node APIs

Legacy Pi extensions are *written in TS/JS*, but they mostly target the **Pi
ExtensionAPI** (`@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`), not Node’s `fs`/`net`/etc.

In practice, the high-value extension behaviors are:
- register tools/commands/flags
- listen to Pi lifecycle events (turn/session/tool)
- read session state and emit custom entries/messages
- execute constrained commands (`pi.exec`) and use Pi tools (`read/write/edit/...`)

This means we do **not** need to embed Node/Bun to reach compatibility. We need a
Pi-shaped API surface with a small, capability-gated connector layer.

## 1. Compatibility Tiers

| Tier | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| Compatible | Matches expected behavior | Run silently |
| Warning | Works with constraints | Run + warn |
| Blocked | Unsafe/unsupported | Deny |

Default policy is **best‑effort** (Compatible/Warning run). `strict` mode blocks
Warnings unless explicitly approved.

## 1A. Unmodified Compatibility (Normative)

The expanded extension corpus work (`bd-po15`) is explicitly about proving that **real-world**
extensions run **unmodified**. If an extension needs “special handling”, that is a gap in Pi’s
runtime/shims/harness — not a reason to patch the extension.

### Definition: “unmodified”

An extension is **unmodified-compatible** if it can be executed from its pinned provenance with:
- deterministic TS→JS compilation (if the source is TS),
- deterministic bundling (if multi-file),
- deterministic import/specifier rewrites (e.g. Node builtins → `pi:node/*`),
- Pi-provided shims/connectors that are **generic** (apply to classes of extensions, not one-off),

…and **without** manual edits to the extension’s logic.

### Allowed transformations (build-time)

Allowed (and should be logged/audited):
- transpilation (TypeScript → JavaScript)
- bundling (directory → single artifact) with deterministic module resolution
- canonical rewrites (specifier mapping, path canonicalization)
- injecting generic compatibility helpers (e.g. `pi:node/*` shims), provided the mapping is
  deterministic and the helpers are versioned

Not allowed:
- per-extension patches (editing source to “make it work”)
- post-bundle “sed fixes” or other opaque transformations
- runtime branching on extension identity (`if extension_id == "foo" { … }`)

### What happens when an “unmodified” extension fails?

- If the extension is using a legacy Pi API surface: implement the protocol mapping/shims.
- If it uses Node builtins: extend the generic `pi:node/*` shim set (or mark Blocked with a precise
  compatibility-scanner finding).
- If it requires network/auth: add deterministic harness support (VCR/offline error-path scenarios).
- Only exclude the extension if it violates a gate (license/redistribution, unpinnable provenance,
  or genuinely unsafe/unsupported primitives).

See `docs/EXTENSION_POPULARITY_CRITERIA.md` for the selection rubric that assumes this contract.

## 2. Legacy API → Protocol Mapping

### Registration
Legacy:
- `registerExtension()` → New `register` message

Protocol payload:
```json
{
  "name": "my-extension",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "api_version": "1.0",
  "capabilities": ["read", "http"],
  "tools": [...],
  "slash_commands": [...],
  "event_hooks": ["onMessage", "onToolResult"]
}
```

### Tools
Legacy:
- `tools: [{ name, description, schema, handler }]`

New:
- `tool_call` → `tool_result`

### Slash Commands
Legacy:
- `slashCommands: { "/foo": handler }`

New:
- `slash_command` → `slash_result`

### Event Hooks
Legacy:
- `onMessage`, `onToolResult`, `onSessionStart`, `onSessionEnd`

New:
- `event_hook` with `event` type + JSON payload

## 3. Unsupported / Degraded Features

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Custom TUI rendering | Blocked | Core UI remains Rust‑only |
| Node native addons | Blocked | Use hostcalls or WASM |
| Unbounded filesystem access | Warning/Blocked | Requires explicit capability |

---

## 4. Compatibility Scanner (Static + Dynamic)

**Static pass (SWC AST):**
- Detect forbidden imports (fs, child_process, net).
- Detect top‑level `eval`, dynamic `require`.
- Classify **compatibility tier**.

**Dynamic pass (runtime):**
- Hostcall access violations → downgrade to Warning/Blocked.
- Record in audit ledger for future decisions.

---

## 5. Hostcall Surface (Legacy Shim)

The compatibility layer provides a **Pi connector surface** (names illustrative):
- `pi.tool(name, input)` → call a built-in tool (`read/write/edit/bash/grep/find/ls`)
- `pi.exec(command, args, options)` → constrained process runner (timeout + cleanup)
- `pi.http(request)` → constrained HTTP client (policy-controlled)
- `pi.session.*` → session manager actions (append entry, set label/name, etc.)
- `pi.ui.*` → UI requests (notifications/widgets via core rendering)
- `pi.log({level, event, message, correlation, data?})` → structured logging (`ext.log.v1`)

Each hostcall is capability‑gated.

## 6. Best‑Effort Philosophy

If a legacy extension uses unsupported APIs:
1. Warn with **precise reasons**.
2. Attempt a fallback when safe.
3. Provide a migration hint.

> Best‑effort means “try hard,” not “pretend it worked.”
